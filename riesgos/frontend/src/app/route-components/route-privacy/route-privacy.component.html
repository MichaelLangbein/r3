        the General Data Protection Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act:</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">1. Personal data</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or
        identifiable natural person (hereinafter: ‘data subject’). An identifiable
        natural person is one who can be identified – directly or indirectly – in
        particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification
        number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific
        to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
        identity of that natural person.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">2. Data subject</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Processing is any operation or set of operations performed on personal data
        or on sets of personal data – whether or not by automated means – such as
        collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or
        alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
        dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination,
        restriction, deletion or destruction.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">4. Restriction of processing</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Restriction of processing means the marking of stored personal data with
        the aim of limiting its processing in the future.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">5. Profiling</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data
        consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
        relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
        concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation,
        health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
        movements.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">6. Pseudonymisation</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a manner
        that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject
        without the use of additional information, provided that such additional
        information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational
        measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified
        or identifiable natural person.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">7. Controller or data processing controller</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Controller or data processing controller means the natural or legal person,
        public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others,
        determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the
        purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State
        law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided
        for by Union or Member State law.</span></p>

        another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party
        or not. However, public authorities that may receive personal data in the
        framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law
        shall not be regarded as recipients.</span></p>

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">10. Third party</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Third party means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
        body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the
        direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process

    <p><i><span lang="EN-US">11.Consent</span></i><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and
        unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a
        statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the

    <h3>5. General information on data processing</h3>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">1. Scope of processing
          of personal data</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">We process personal data concerning our users exclusively to the extent
        required to provide a functioning website, as well as our content and services.
        Ordinarily, we will only process the personal data of our users after obtaining
        their consent. An exception to this rule is where obtaining prior consent is factually
        impossible and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">2. Legal grounds for
          the processing of personal data</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Where we obtain consent from the data subject for the processing of
        personal data, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (a)
        of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Where personal data is processed for the performance of a contract in which
        the data subject is a contractual partner, the legal grounds are set out in
        Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (b) of the GDPR. This also applies to processing that
        is necessary for pre-contractual measures.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Where personal data is processed for compliance with a legal obligation to
        which our research centre is subject, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6,
        paragraph 1, part (c) of the GDPR.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Where processing of personal data is necessary for the protection of vital
        interests of the data subject or another natural person, the legal grounds are
        set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (d) of the GDPR.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of our research
        centre or a third party, and where the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
        data subject do not override the first interests, the legal grounds are set out
        in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the GDPR.</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">3. Data deletion and
          duration of data storage</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as
        the purpose of storage no longer applies. In addition, storage takes place if
        authorised by Union or Member State directives, laws or other regulations to
        which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data shall also
        take place when a storage period stipulated by one of the above standards comes
        to an end, except where it is necessary to continue storing the data to enter into
        or perform a contract.</span></p>

    <h3>6. Provision of the website and generation of log
      files</h3>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">a) Description and
          scope of data processing</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Our system automatically collects data and information from the accessing
        computer system each time our website is visited.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The following data is collected in this context:</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The data is also stored in log files kept on our system. This data is not
        stored together with other personal data concerning the user.</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">b)&nbsp;Legal grounds
          for data processing</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The legal grounds for temporary storage of the data and log files are set
        out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the EU General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR).</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">c)&nbsp;Purpose of data
          processing</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Temporary storage of the IP address by our system is necessary to deliver
        the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the user’s IP
        address must be stored for the duration of the session.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">Storage in log files takes place to ensure functionality of the website. In
        addition, the data is used to optimise the website and to ensure security of
        our Information Technology systems. Data analysis for marketing purposes does
        not take place in this context.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">DLR does not draw any conclusions about the identity of the data subject
        during use of the data mentioned under a). Instead, this information is
        necessary to (1) deliver the contents of our website in their correct form; to
        (2) optimise the contents of our website and promote it; to (3) guarantee the
        permanent functionality of our information technology systems and equipment
        used for our website; and to (4) provide the information necessary for law
        enforcement organisations to investigate cyber-attacks.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">These purposes justify our legitimate interests in data processing
        according to Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the GDPR.</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">d) Duration of storage</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose for
        which it was collected. In the case of data collection for the provision of
        this website, this applies at the end of each session.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">In the case of data stored in log files, this occurs after no longer than fourteen
        days. Further storage is possible; in these cases, the users’ IP addresses are
        deleted or pseudonymised to prevent any association with the accessing client.</span></p>

    <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US">e) Right to objection
          and removal</span></i></p>

    <p><span lang="EN-US">The collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of
        data in log files is crucial to operation of the website. Hence, users are not
        granted a right to object.</span></p>
