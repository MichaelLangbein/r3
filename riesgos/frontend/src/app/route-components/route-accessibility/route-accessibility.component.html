  <h1>Ac­ces­si­bil­i­ty state­ment</h1>

  <p>This
      accessibility statement is valid for the website activations.zki.dlr.de of the
      German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.; DLR).</p>

  <p>As a public
      sector body of the German Federal Government within the meaning of EU Directive
      2016/2102, we endeavour to make our websites and mobile applications accessible
      in accordance with the provisions set out in the German Equality for Persons
      with Disabilities Act (BGG) and the German Barrier-Free Information Technology
      Ordinance (BITV 2.0) in order to implement EU Directive 2016/2102.</p>

  <h2>Compliance status</h2>

  <p>The
      accessibility requirements stem from Sections 3 (1) to (4) and 4 of BITV 2.0,
      adopted on the basis of Section 12d BGG.</p>

  <p>At present,
      <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">the website</span>
      is partially compliant with the aforementioned requirements. The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">website</span> is
      currently being reviewed with regard to accessibility. It is therefore possible
      that not all accessibility requirements have been fully met. We are working on
      addressing all identified accessibility problems.
  </p>

      between people with disabilities and federal public bodies. The conciliation
      procedure is free of charge. No legal assistance is required.</p>
