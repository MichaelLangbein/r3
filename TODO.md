# Design
 - all harmonization in python-script
 - all state in frontend


# Todos
- dependencies between steps
  - depended paras back to python
  - on "reset", delete all dependent data
- provide wms
- host compiled angular-app through flask
- provide package on pip
- step-state
  - styling
  - body: form vs value



# Clear up
- How do I deal with dependencies between nodes that differ between backend and frontend?
  - Example: deus requires a backend-point-intensity, but frontend shows a wms-intensity
