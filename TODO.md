- where should state live - backend or frontend?
  - if backend: how should it be represented? How transferred?
  - <= no, frontend! backend needs to be available to many users at once. 
    - <= but the way it currently works it's not. It uses one global state. Make instances of one class!
- only allow one step after its dependencies have run
- allow to re-set steps
  - delete their downstream dependencies
